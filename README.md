# PacMan-Exercise
This project was my first real introduction to Javascript. Using page boundaries and set timeout, and creating my first animation. I added a small touch of a pink background once I learned a little more CSS. Very basic but it took me a very long time. I had a hard time even organizing all my files in the correct way- that's how inexperienced I was. 
Make sure and open up the file folder, clone and fork the folder, open up your favorite editor and get coding!
